What main “feature” of natural languages prevents their use (so far) as programming languages,
and why?
One pf feature of natural languages that prevents their use as programming languages is Ambiguity. Natural languages use
a lot of ambiguity because they can use context cues in order to understand what is being said whereas programming languages
only have one meaning to one specific statement.
